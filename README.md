# Big-Data-Analytics-And-Applications

The objective of this course is to explore the emerging concepts of Big Data Analytics (Machine Learning) and applications and gain an insight into the potential of new ML applications. In this course, students will have hand-on experience with Big Data technologies (Apache Spark, Google TensorFlow) and tools (Intellij, Pycharm, Maven/SBT)  for the analysis of large and various data sets across diverse platforms or domains. Specifically, students will gain a unique experience with Android app development, big data analytics (Spark/TensorFlow), web services, robotics and sensor technologies to connect between big data analytics platforms. In particular, students will learn how to facilitate natural and intuitive human-software-robot collaboration that can enhance human insight and creativity through highly interactive virtual reality and robotic applications.
